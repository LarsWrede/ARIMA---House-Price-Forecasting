# Housing price forecasting in selected US cities during the COVID-19 pandemic
This repository contains multiple documents, including a presentation, a micro-publication and the scripts we developed for our analysis of the housing price dynamics within a univariate time series forecast for three cities in the United States (US) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) was used as it explains the housing market based on its own past values, in detail its own lags as well as the lagged forecast errors. Subsequently, the resulting excess trend was regressed against total infections for each of the three cities.
Prices on the US real estate market, represented by selected local housing markets, are growing continuously despite the COVID-19 pandemic with an even accelerated trend for the observed characteristics.
